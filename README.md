## Project Description
This project is being undertaken by us as part of our ITSP - Institute Technical Summer Project 2021. 

![Alt text](https://repository-images.githubusercontent.com/259342137/d5061e00-8ad0-11ea-9e14-8fe811b5cc49 "a title")

The main of this project is to develop a model which can generate music on its own. We hope to do this using neural networks, specifically RNNs and LSTM. We will be coding in Python and use PyTorch as our machine learning library. 

This repo contains all our code implementations as Jupyter notebooks, along with links to relevant resouces and a .docx file where we have put brief descriptions of whatever material we cover as part of our prerequisite learning for the project.

In the first specialization, Andrew Ng talks about the fundamental concepts of deep learning, and how to build neural nets using Python.
In the second course he talks about how to improve performance of our model, basically about hyperparameter tuning, regularization etc.
In the third course, he talks about how to diagnose errors in machine learning 
system, strategies to reduce errors etc.
In the fourth course, he has talked about how to apply CNNs to visual detection and recognition tasks, and use neural network style to generate art and apply these algorithms to a variety of images. 
Fifth course is about sequence models and their application is speech recognition, audio synthesis, NLP and more.
