This repository is a part of the Institute Technical Summer Project(ITSP) for the year 2020-21.
It contains the implementation for linear regression and logistic regression in pytorch and a basic neural network.

- The resources we used can be found [here](https://jovian.ai/aakashns/01-pytorch-basics).

## Datasets
- We used the [MNIST dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv) for logistic regression and to train a neural network
- For the convolutional Neural Network, we used the [Cats and Dogs dataset](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765)
